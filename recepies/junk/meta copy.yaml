  description: >
    pyEPR is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-efficiency,
    easy-to-use analysis functions and automation for the design of quantum
    chips based on superconducting quantum circuits, both distributed and lumped.
    pyEPR interfaces the classical distributed microwave analysis with that of 
    quantum structures and Hamiltonians. It is chiefly based on the energy participation 
    ratio approach; however, it has since v0.4 extended to cover a broad range of
    design approaches. pyEPR stradels the analysis from Maxwell’s to Schrodinger’s
    equations, and converts the solutions of distributed microwve (typically eignmode
    simulations) to a fully diagonalized spectrum of the energy levels, couplings,
    and key parameters of a many-body quantum Hamiltonian.
